# Concurrency With Asynchronous Messages

In this project I implemented a Simple Hospital Triage Process, using asynchronous messages. The aim of this project is simulate a hospital triage process, when patients arrive to triage process, he gives a priority and forwards to central process. The Central process enqueue it in the queue with the respective priority, the queue is alwalys ordered by priority. The health provider processes will attend patients.
